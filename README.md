### MUST FOLLOW CODE QUALITY INSTRUCTIONS

## Project Name

## Description

**REPLACE FIREBASE FILES**
Make sure to replace googleservice.json of your project in android folder and googleservice.plist
**Your Project Desciption** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### IMPORTANT MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW ALL THESE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW

## Code Quality Instructions

# Unused Modules

      Delete any unused modules from the project.

# Unused Imports and Variables etc:

      Remove every unused import, variable, and function.

# Component Usage

      Use components effectively during development.

# Duplication

      Keep code duplicacy less than 3%.

# Naming Conventions

      Follow camel case when declaring variables, functions, classes, etc.

# Usage of Constants

      Avoid to use contants like screennames manually try to declare constants in a seperate file import and use it some other constants examples are colors fonts etc.

# envs

      Make sure to decalre Api keys in envs and any other data that is sensitive declare in env.

# Avoid Unknown, any and undefined (if project in Typescript)

      Make sure to define types for every possible module avoid using undefined any unknown

# Sonar Friendliness

      Ensure that your code is Sonar-friendly.

# Troubleshooting
